# BLE-localization-algorithm

the system is built up based on TI instrument's CC2640R2 launchpad, the receiver will send the IQ data to PC through the serial in the form of hex, 
run main.m for the real time BLE localization algorithm
run CRLB_run.m and SPEB_run.m to evaluate the performance of the algorithm and run CRLB_plot.m, SPEB_plot.m to show the results
